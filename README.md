# nasa_space_apps_2016

This is repository for the script files used for NASA Space Apps 2016 Challenge. The challenge was on Near Earth Objects Machine Learning.

The script firstly obtains asteroid data from MPC (Minor Planet Center) Web Service. Then uses part of its values as a teaching set for Machine Learning Algorithm (in this case Bayesian Linear Regression) and produces predictions which are compared to real values by means of plotting and MSE calculations. Same comparison is used for traditional calculation methods. Overall the MSE of machine learning approach is smaller than the one for traditional assumption methods.
